Create a relevant dataset, choose appropriate images, and design and code an application to display this information.

Pictograph
A pictograph displays data using pictures. Every pictograph has a title, label, key, and some pictures or symbols.

Your design and colour should be unique to you, and you should pay attention to OOP principles as taught this semester. You may reuse and re-purpose code and classes developed and used (by you) in the Labs
